🛠 Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Newton2n/image-sharing-platform.git
cd image-sharing-platform


Install dependencies

npm install

🤖Set Up Appwrite

Visit your Appwrite Console and create a new project.

Auth: Enable Email/Password authentication.

Database: Create a database named post.

Collections: Create two collections:

usersPost (for storing post data)

usersProfile (for user metadata)

Storage: Create a Bucket for images.

🔑 Appwrite API Key Configuration
Create a new API Key in your Appwrite Console (Integration > API Keys) and select the following scopes:

Databases:

row.read (Read rows)
row.write (Create, update, and delete rows)

Storage:

files.read (Read files and previews)
files.write (Create, update, and delete files)
.
Create a .env.local file in the root and add:
# Appwrite Public Config (Client-side)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_URL="" ,

NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="" ,

NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID="" ,

NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_TABLE_ID="" ,

NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_USERS_PROFILE_INFORMATION_TABLE_ID="" ,

# Appwrite Secret Key (Server-side Only)
# WARNING: Do not prefix this with NEXT_PUBLIC_
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID="" ,

# Editor Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINYMCE_API_KEY="";

💡 TinyMCE API Key

To integrate TinyMCE as your rich text editor, you need a Tiny Cloud API key:

Go to https://www.tiny.cloud/
 and create a free account.

On your Tiny Cloud dashboard, get your API key.

Add that key under NEXT_PUBLIC_TINYMCE_API_KEY in your .env.local.

This allows TinyMCE to load properly and prevents editor warnings.

Important: Do not commit sensitive API keys to your repository. Add .env* to .gitignore.

▶️ Running Locally

Start the development server:

npm run dev


Open http://localhost:3000
 in your browser.

📦 Usage

Once running:

✔ Register a new account
✔ Log in
✔ Upload images
✔ Edit or delete your posts
✔ View images from all users

All forms include frontend validation to prevent incorrect input.
